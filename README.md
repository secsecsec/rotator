# rotator
A simple tool for maintaining oncall rotations in Google Calendar. Currently
only does a day-by-day rotation and assumes you're in Austria for the purposes
of calculating public holidays, but hey, it's a start. Mostly self-documenting
(start in `rotator.go`). Okay, that's an excuse for there not being any proper
documentation here. I should fix that.
